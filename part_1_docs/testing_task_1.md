### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python
class CardGame:
  
# = on line 21 should be ==
# else on line 23 should be else:
  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   
# dif in line 30 should be def
# parameters card1 and card2 should be separated by a comma
# the if statement needs to be indented
# card in line 32 should be card1
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  

# the total variable in line 41 should have a value
# return in line 44 should be indented at the same level as for in line 42
# there should be a space at the end of the return string  
def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
